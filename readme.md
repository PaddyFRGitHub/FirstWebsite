# Front-End Web Development Assignment - Personal Portfolio

## Project Description
For this assignment I chose to produce a personal portfolio website that I can use to highlight my work and possibly show to potential employers to demonstrate my abilities. My aim for the general aesthetic of the website was simplicity and accessibility. I want users to be able to navigate the site with ease and locate the things they would be looking for from me. This meant using a relatively simple but aesthetic nav-bar on each page with links to the relevant pages. I wanted the page to be clear and concise that it was my portfolio which is why I put emphasis on the logo on the index page and in the top left of the nav-bar.

## Screen-Size Adaptation
In order to make my site friendly for mobile users, I ensured that I put consistent media screens in my code so that it can be resized accordingly without breaking the flow of the content and making it look messy. I put a few different breaks for this, E.G. at 1320px, 1100px and 750px and all content can be viewed properly at 400px.

## Further Explanation/Issues
I have worked within graphic design areas previously and wanted to showcase some work, however when I tried to implement a speedart youtube video of said work, the video didn't embed properly and would not play directly from the portfolio. I believe this may have been due to copyrighting regulations on youtube that do not allow embedding or it could have been an issue with the video as other videos embedded just fine. It also resulted in some console errors in the browser. Instead of this, I put an img with relevant work and on click it takes you to a new tab where you can view it at full size.
